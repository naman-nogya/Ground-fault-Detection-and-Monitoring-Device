# Ground-fault-Detection-and-Monitoring-Device
A real-time earth leakage and monitoring system is essential for ensuring electrical safety and preventing property damage. This system employs a current transformer to measure current flow, a microcontroller to analyze data, and a communication module to send alerts. When a fault is detected, the system activates visual and audible alarms, notifies the electrical department, and potentially integrates with home automation systems. This proactive approach helps in timely fault isolation and minimizes risks associated with earth leakage incidents. Other than that, environmental and other data from sensors can enable real-time monitoring of flood conditions and facilitate predictive maintenance for high-voltage devices. This information is crucial for efficient resource management and ensuring public safety.
